            YANG-CBOR: Allocating SID ranges for PEN holders
                  draft-ietf-core-yang-sid-pen-latest

Abstract

   YANG-CBOR, RFC 9254 defines YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID),
   globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.
   RFC 9595 defines ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA
   registries.

   The present specification uses these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate ranges with 100 000 63-bit SIDs each for each of the first
   1 000 000 holders of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers
   (PENs), as well as ranges with 10 000 32-bit SIDs each for each of
   the first 100 000 holders.

1.  Introduction

   YANG-CBOR, [RFC9254] defines YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID),
   globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.
   RFC 9595 defines ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA
   registries.

   The present specification uses these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate ranges with 100 000 63-bit SIDs each for each of the first
   1 000 000 holders of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers
   (PENs), as well as ranges with 10 000 32-bit SIDs each for each of
   the first 100 000 holders.

   IANA [is requested to allocate/has allocated] 100 000 mega-ranges,
   for the SID numbers 300 000 000 000 to 399 999 999 999.

Internet-Draft         SID ranges for PEN holders             April 2025


   IANA also [is requested to allocate/has allocated] 1000 mega-ranges,
   for the SID numbers 3 000 000 000 to 3 999 999 999.

   The holder of a PEN ppp ppp then can use the SID numbers
   3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999 for allocation in a scheme defined
   by the holder.  The holder of a PEN pp ppp then can use the SID
   numbers 3 ppp pp0 000 to 3 ppp pp9 999 for allocation in a scheme
   defined by the holder.

2.  Example

   The Department for Mathematics and Computer Science of Universität
   Bremen holds PEN 30810.

   This confers control over the SID range 303 081 000 000 up to
   303 081 099 999, as well as 3 308 100 000 up to 3 308 109 999 up to
   to this PEN holder.

3.  Discussion

   This allocation provides an extremely-low-threshold way for PEN
   holders to get number space for the YANG SIDs used in their YANG
   modules.  It is, however, not always the approach to recommend to a
   module author:

   *  The large space uses 64-bit numbers.  While this is of relatively
      little consequence due to the delta-encoding used for SIDs in
      YANG-CBOR, a few further bytes can be saved by allocating the SIDs
      in one of the mega-ranges that are specifically allocated by an
      organization (which, for the first 2000 or so, will lead to 32-bit
      outer deltas).

   *  For the first 100 000 PEN holders, there also is a smaller space
      that uses 32-bit numbers.  This space is likely to run out before
      or around 2040; the expectation is that by that time there will be
      enough opportunities to request ranges from a megarange operator
      that this mechanism is no longer needed.

   *  This space has no infrastructure to discover the YANG module
      behind a SID.  Of course, each PEN holder can provide such
      infrastructure, but even then the problem remains how to find that
      infrastructure for a SID.  (Search engines may mitigate this
      somewhat.)  On the other hand, relative obscurity may be exactly
      what a PEN holder wants to achieve by using this mechanism.

   Relying on the PEN registry might theoretically trigger a land-grab
   by prospective writers of YANG modules.  However, PENs have been
   around for decades [RFC1065] and such a land-grab hasn't occurred for
   the other allocations implicitly provided by obtaining a PEN.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document allocates 100 000 63-bit and 1000 32-bit SID mega-
   ranges as per Section 7.4 of [RFC9595].

   The contact for the allocation is: IETF CORE Working Group
   (core@ietf.org) or IETF Applications and Real-Time Area
   (art@ietf.org)

   The allocation policy inside the mega-range is "private".  The URL is
   that of the present specification.

   The management of the SID blocks of 100 000 SIDs each, 10 such blocks
   for each mega-range 3nn nnn 000 000, is delegated to the PEN holder
   for nnn nnx, where x is the sequence number of the SID block in the
   mega-range (i.e., the PEN holder for nnn nnx controls SID
   3nn nnn x00 000 to 3nn nnn x99 999).

   Similarly, the management of the SID blocks of 10 000 SIDs each, 100
   such blocks for each mega-range 3 nnn 000 000, is delegated to the
   PEN holder for nn nxx, where x is the sequence number of the SID
   block in the mega-range (i.e., the PEN holder for nn nxx controls SID
   3 nnn xx0 000 to 3 nnn xx9 999).

   The technical capacity to ensure the sustained operation of the
   registry for a period of at least 10 years (as required for
   registries of class "private") is derived from the capacity of IANA
   to maintain the PEN number registry.
