            YANG-CBOR: Allocating SID ranges for PEN holders
                  draft-ietf-core-yang-sid-pen-latest

Abstract

   YANG-CBOR (RFC 9254, "Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG in the
   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)") defines YANG Schema
   Item iDentifiers (YANG SID), globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers
   used to identify YANG items.  RFC 9595 ("YANG Schema Item iDentifier
   (YANG SID)") defines ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA
   registries.

   The present specification employs these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate ranges with 100 000 SIDs (representation size 64 bits) each
   for each of the holders of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers
   (PENs) < 1 000 000, as well as ranges with 10 000 SIDs
   (representation size 32 bits) each for each of the holders of PENs <
   100 000.


   // The present revision –04 is intended to address the feedback from
   // the AD review and the IETF last call.  Note that due to a
   // regression in the bib.ietf.org service (https://github.com/ietf-
   // tools/bibxml-service/issues/489 (https://github.com/ietf-tools/
   // bibxml-service/issues/489)), the reference
   // [IANA.enterprise-numbers] may come out as "*** BROKEN REFERENCE
   // ***" in some CI systems; this will certainly be fixed in the
   // course of further processing.

Internet-Draft         SID ranges for PEN holders          December 2025


1.  Introduction

   YANG-CBOR [RFC9254] defines YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID),
   globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.
   [RFC9595] defines ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA
   registries.

   The present specification employs these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate ranges with 100 000 SIDs (representation size 64 bits) each
   for each of the holders of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers
   (PENs) < 1 000 000, as well as ranges with 10 000 SIDs
   (representation size 32 bits) each for each of the holders of PENs <
   100 000.

   IANA [is requested to allocate/has allocated] a mega-range with
   100 billion SIDs (representation size 64 bits), for the SID numbers
   300 000 000 000 to 399 999 999 999.

   IANA also [is requested to allocate/has allocated] a mega-range with
   1 billion SIDs (representation size 32 bits), for the SID numbers
   3 000 000 000 to 3 999 999 999.

   Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs) are registered in
   [IANA.enterprise-numbers] in a low-threshold, low-overhead
   registration process.  At the time of writing (~ 37 years after
   creating this registry), around 65 000 PENs are registered.  In this
   document, the registrant for a PEN is referred to as the "PEN
   holder".

   The present specification makes the following SID ranges available to
   certain (current or future) PEN holders for allocation in a scheme
   defined by the holder:

   *  The holder of a PEN ppp ppp (< 1 000 000) can use the SID numbers
      3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999.

   *  The holder of a PEN pp ppp (< 100 000) can use the SID numbers
      3 ppp pp0 000 to 3 ppp pp9 999.

2.  Example

   [RFC5612] has allocated Enterprise Number 32473 "for use in examples
   in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like".

   If this Enterprise Number had an actual PEN holder, the present
   specification would confer control to it over the SID ranges:

   *  3*03 247 3*00 000 up to 3*03 247 3*99 999, and

Internet-Draft         SID ranges for PEN holders          December 2025


   *  3 *324 73*0 000 up to 3 *324 73*9 999.

   (The plaintext form of this document shows "*" characters around the
   digits conveying the PEN, which are shown in *boldface* in the
   typographic forms.)

   As Enterprise Number 32473 is intended to be used in documentation,
   the SIDs in the two SID ranges listed here for the documentation PEN
   are consequently also available for use in documentation.

3.  Discussion

   This allocation provides an extremely-low-threshold (zero-
   interaction) way for PEN holders to get number space for the YANG
   SIDs used in their YANG modules.  If a PEN is not already available
   to the entity needing such number space, it can be obtained in a very
   low-threshold process.  Employing this number space is, however, not
   always the approach to recommend to a module author:

   *  In the larger of the two spaces, each SID number needs a
      representation size of 64 bits ("64-bit SIDs").  (This larger
      representation size of the absolute value of the SID is of
      comparatively little consequence due to the delta-encoding used
      for SIDs in YANG-CBOR.)

   *  For the holders of PENs < 100 000, there additionally is a smaller
      space where each SID number needs a representation size of 32 bits
      ("32-bit SIDs").  PEN numbers that have access to this space (PEN
      < 100 000) are likely to run out before or around 2040; the
      expectation is that by that time there will be enough
      opportunities to request SID ranges within mega-ranges allocated
      by other registrants that this mechanism is less needed.

   *  This space has no infrastructure to discover the YANG module
      behind a SID.  Of course, each PEN holder can provide such
      infrastructure, but even then the problem remains of how to find
      that infrastructure for a SID.  (Search engines may mitigate this
      somewhat.)  On the other hand, in some cases this relative
      obscurity may be exactly what a PEN holder wants to achieve by
      using this mechanism.

      If obscurity is not the intention, one or both of the following
      approaches are encouraged:

      -  The PEN holder can provide a public repository where their YANG
         models can be found alongside the applicable SID files.  Such a
         repository may be easy to set up using a popular git forge such
         as, at the time of writing, GitHub.

Internet-Draft         SID ranges for PEN holders          December 2025


      -  Implementations that employ PEN-based SIDs can facilitate
         information discovery by providing [I-D.ietf-core-yang-library]
         or another form of YANG library [RFC8525].

   Relying on the PEN registry might theoretically trigger a land-grab
   by prospective writers of YANG modules.  However, PENs have been
   around for decades (see Section 3.1.4 of [RFC1065], which continues
   to be in force with no technical changes as Section 3.1.4 of RFC 1155
   [STD16]), and such a land-grab has not occurred for the other
   allocations implicitly provided by obtaining a PEN.

4.  IANA Considerations


   // RFC Ed.: throughout this section, please replace RFC-XXXX with the
   // RFC number of this specification and remove this note.

   As per Section 6.3 of [RFC9595], in the "YANG-SID Mega-Ranges"
   registry within the "YANG SIDs" registry group [IANA.yang-sid], this
   document allocates two mega-ranges, one with 1 billion SIDs ranging
   from 3 000 000 000 up to 3 999 999 999 (32-bit representation size),
   and one with 100 billion SIDs ranging from 300 000 000 000 up to
   399 999 999 999 (64-bit representation size), as summarized in
   Table 1.

     Table 1: YANG-SID Mega-Range Allocations for use by PEN holders

   IANA is requested to mark the following ranges as reserved for
   documentation:

   *  303 247 300 000 up to 303 247 399 999

   *  3 324 730 000 up to 3 324 739 999

   An additional contact for the allocation is: IETF CORE Working Group
   (core@ietf.org) or IETF Applications and Real-Time Area
   (art@ietf.org).

   The allocation policy inside the mega-range is "private".  The URL is
   that of the present specification.

   The management of the SID block of 100 000 SIDs each, ranging from
   3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999, is delegated to the PEN holder
   for PEN ppp ppp (i.e., the PEN holder for ppp ppp controls SID
   3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999).

   Similarly, the management of the SID block of 10 000 SIDs each,
   ranging from 3 ppp pp0 000 to 3 ppp pp9 999, is delegated to the PEN
   holder for PEN pp ppp (i.e., the PEN holder for pp ppp controls SID
   3 ppp pp0 000 to 3 ppp pp9 999).

   Section 6.3.2 of [RFC9595] requires an organization that requests an
   entry in the "YANG-SID Mega-Ranges" registry to ensure the technical
   capacity to manage the SID ranges within those mega-ranges for a
   period of at least 10 years (Private ranges).  The individual SID
   ranges within the mega-ranges allocated in this document are assigned
   through the registration of PEN numbers.  The technical capacity to
   ensure the sustained operation of the PEN number registry is derived
   from the demonstrated capacity of IANA to maintain this registry as
   well as the importance of a functioning PEN number registry in other
   contexts.

5.  Security Considerations

   Section 5 (Security Considerations) of [RFC9595] applies, as well as
   Section 8 (Security Considerations) of [RFC9254].  In particular, the
   fact that a certain Private Enterprise Number appears in a SID is not
   an indicator of provenance, i.e., it does not guarantee that the SID
   or underlying YANG model actually does originate from the holder of
   that PEN.  The requirement to ascertain the authoritative source of
   this information, as discussed in the above security considerations,
   remains.
