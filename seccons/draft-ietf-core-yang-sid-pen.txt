            YANG-CBOR: Allocating SID ranges for PEN holders
                  draft-ietf-core-yang-sid-pen-latest

Abstract

   YANG-CBOR, RFC 9254 defines YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID),
   globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.
   RFC 9595 defines ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA
   registries.

   The present specification employs these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate ranges with 100 000 63-bit SIDs each for each of the first
   1 000 000 holders of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers
   (PENs), as well as ranges with 10 000 32-bit SIDs each for each of
   the first 100 000 holders.

1.  Introduction

   YANG-CBOR [RFC9254] defines YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID),
   globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.
   RFC 9595 defines ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA
   registries.

   The present specification employs these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate ranges with 100 000 63-bit SIDs each for each of the first
   1 000 000 holders of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers
   (PENs), as well as ranges with 10 000 32-bit SIDs each for each of
   the first 100 000 holders.

Internet-Draft         SID ranges for PEN holders         September 2025


   IANA [is requested to allocate/has allocated] 100 000 mega-ranges,
   for the SID numbers 300 000 000 000 to 399 999 999 999.

   IANA also [is requested to allocate/has allocated] 1000 mega-ranges,
   for the SID numbers 3 000 000 000 to 3 999 999 999.

   Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs) are registered in
   [IANA.enterprise-numbers] in a low-threshold, low-overhead
   registration process.  At the time of writing (~ 37 years after
   creating this registry), around 65 000 PENs are registered.  We speak
   of the registrant for a PEN as the "PEN holder".

   The present specification makes the following SID ranges available to
   certain (current or future) PEN holders for allocation in a scheme
   defined by the holder:

   *  The holder of a PEN ppp ppp (< 1 000 000) can use the SID numbers
      3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999.

   *  The holder of a PEN pp ppp (< 100 000) can use the SID numbers
      3 ppp pp0 000 to 3 ppp pp9 999.

2.  Example

   The Department for Mathematics and Computer Science of Universität
   Bremen holds PEN 30810.

   To this PEN holder, the present specification confers control over
   the SID ranges:

   *  3*03 081 0*00 000 up to 3*03 081 0*99 999, and

   *  3 *308 10*0 000 up to 3 *308 10*9 999.

   (The plaintext form of this document shows "*" characters around the
   digits conveying the PEN, which are shown in *boldface* in the
   typographic forms.)

3.  Discussion

   This allocation provides an extremely-low-threshold (zero-
   interaction) way for PEN holders to get number space for the YANG
   SIDs used in their YANG modules.  If a PEN is not already available
   to the entity needing such number space, it can be obtained in a very
   low-threshold process.  Employing this number space is, however, not
   always the approach to recommend to a module author:

   *  The large space uses 64-bit numbers.  While this is of relatively
      little consequence due to the delta-encoding used for SIDs in
      YANG-CBOR, a few further bytes can be saved by allocating the SIDs
      in one of the mega-ranges that are specifically allocated by an
      organization (which, for the first 2000 or so, will lead to 32-bit
      outer deltas).

   *  For the first 100 000 PEN holders, there also is a smaller space
      that uses 32-bit numbers.  This space is likely to run out before
      or around 2040; the expectation is that by that time there will be
      enough opportunities to request ranges from a megarange operator
      that this mechanism is no longer needed.

   *  This space has no infrastructure to discover the YANG module
      behind a SID.  Of course, each PEN holder can provide such
      infrastructure, but even then the problem remains how to find that
      infrastructure for a SID.  (Search engines may mitigate this
      somewhat.)  On the other hand, in some cases this relative
      obscurity may be exactly what a PEN holder wants to achieve by
      using this mechanism.

   Relying on the PEN registry might theoretically trigger a land-grab
   by prospective writers of YANG modules.  However, PENs have been
   around for decades (see Section 3.1.4 of [RFC1065], which continues
   to be in force with no technical changes as Section 3.1.4 of RFC 1155
   [STD16]), and such a land-grab hasn't occurred for the other
   allocations implicitly provided by obtaining a PEN.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document allocates 100 000 63-bit and 1000 32-bit SID mega-
   ranges as per Section 7.4 of [RFC9595].

   The contact for the allocation is: IETF CORE Working Group
   (core@ietf.org) or IETF Applications and Real-Time Area
   (art@ietf.org).

   The allocation policy inside the mega-range is "private".  The URL is
   that of the present specification.

   The management of the SID blocks of 100 000 SIDs each, 10 such blocks
   for each mega-range 3nn nnn 000 000, is delegated to the PEN holder
   for nnn nnx, where x is the sequence number of the SID block in the
   mega-range (i.e., the PEN holder for nnn nnx controls SID
   3nn nnn x00 000 to 3nn nnn x99 999).

Internet-Draft         SID ranges for PEN holders         September 2025


   Similarly, the management of the SID blocks of 10 000 SIDs each, 100
   such blocks for each mega-range 3 nnn 000 000, is delegated to the
   PEN holder for nn nxx, where x is the sequence number of the SID
   block in the mega-range (i.e., the PEN holder for nn nxx controls SID
   3 nnn xx0 000 to 3 nnn xx9 999).

   The technical capacity to ensure the sustained operation of the
   registry for a period of at least 10 years (as required for
   registries of class "private") is derived from the capacity of IANA
   to maintain the PEN number registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   Section 5 (Security Considerations) of [RFC9595] applies, as well as
   Section 8 (Security Considerations) of [RFC9254].  In particular, the
   fact that a certain Private Enterprise Number appears in a SID is not
   an indicator of provenance, i.e., it does not guarantee that the SID
   or underlying YANG model actually does originate from the holder of
   that PEN.  The requirement to ascertain the authoritative source of
   this information, as discussed in the above security considerations,
   remains.
